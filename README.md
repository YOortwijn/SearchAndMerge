# SearchAndMerge

The script in this repository are made to search for a certain focal term x, from a list of x terms, with a certain term y in a 20-word context, from a list of y terms. It takes xml as input such that the first column notes that source of the sentence (file name, page number, sentence number) and the second column the corresponding sentence. It outputs the corresponding 41-word passages in the same format. In case passages overlap, the passages are merged (resulting in longer passages). It also counts how many passages are found per file before merging, how long the average passage is, how many passages are found and how many of those are 41-words. 

Due to copyrights, the input and output are not available in this repository. 

Authors are Jelke Bloem and Yvette Oortwijn.
